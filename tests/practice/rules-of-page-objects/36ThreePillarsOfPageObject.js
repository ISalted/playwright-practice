/*
    1. Core concept:
    Each page of the web application has its own "class" with methods/functions responsible
    for operations specific to that page.

    2. DRY principle:
    Don't Repeat Yourself!
    If code is repeated three times, move it into a reusable component.

    3. KISS principles
    Keep It Simple, Stupid!
    Don't overcomplicate and overengineer your code/framework.
    Don't try to impress your developers, friends, or parents.
    Design your framework just enough to be efficient in what it's supposed to do.

    + Two useful practices:
    1. Descriptive naming - give a very good descriptive naming to all instances that you create.
    (Constants, variables, method names, functions, names, class names, instance of the objects.)

    2. Avoid tiny methods -try to keep your methods more meaningful block of the function/flow.
    Don`t do:
        async clickSubmit(){
            awit page.locator('*).click()
        }
